“Arrival” Mobile application
The arrival app, which functions similarly to the Swivel app but with trains that allow users to 
book and track their trains in addition to our control website to monitor the train's status and 
pay for tickets as our payment method.
Along the way, we integrated plenty of new things into our Flutter 
applications, including Firebase, Google services, maps, authentication, SMS OTP verification, 
real-time applications, flutter custom Painter, MQTT client, git, and GitHub, including GitHub 
deployment, and android studio Environment
Using : firebase, google maps, Realtime, flutter, Shared Preference, and third-party login
